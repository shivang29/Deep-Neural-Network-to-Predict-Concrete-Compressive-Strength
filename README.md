# Deep-Neural-Network-to-Predict-Concrete-Compressive-Strength

This Project is to predict what will be the compressive strength of concrete providing initial quantities of its components and the age after mixing and installation.The following materials comprise a mix design: Cementitious materials (e.g. Portland cement, fly ash, etc.), Coarse Aggregate , Fine aggregate , Water and Admixtures .
