# Deep-Neural-Network-to-Predict-Concrete-Compressive-Strength

This Project is to predict what will be the compressive strength of concrete providing initial quantities of its components and the age after mixing and installation.
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.
The following materials comprise a mix design: Cementitious materials (e.g. Portland cement, fly ash, etc.), Coarse Aggregate , Fine aggregate , Water and Admixtures .

# DataSet Used

The dataset was retrieved from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository from the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength. The dataset provides laboratory testing data for 1,030 concrete samples, tested at different curing times, with different mix designs.
There are original dataset present and another modified dataset so that it is easy for data analysis by python.
