# Deep-Neural-Network-to-Predict-Concrete-Compressive-Strength

This Project is to predict what will be the compressive strength of concrete providing initial quantities of its components and the age after mixing and installation.The following materials comprise a mix design: Cementitious materials (e.g. Portland cement, fly ash, etc.), Coarse Aggregate , Fine aggregate , Water and Admixtures .

# DataSet Used

The dataset was retrieved from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository from the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength. The dataset provides laboratory testing data for 1,030 concrete samples, tested at different curing times, with different mix designs.
